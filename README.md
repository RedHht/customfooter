# Custom Footer
This is a footer, a... normal footer, it is made only with HTML, SCSS and CSS, you can add it to any website, and modify it to your liking. I am not a designer so I do not know if it will be very pleasant to look at, that is why in each file there are variables to modify everything a little to your liking and annotations to know what it is doing if you want to modify it.
# Install
### Fast Install
You can add to your styles folder the formated .css file and the lines 20-75 and the line 10 to your code, obviously you MUST import the CSS file to the head and you need to import your fontawesome URL, anyways if you dont have any idea of FontAwesome, you can add the line 5 too in your Head tag. This method its less customizable sooo I recomend the Specialized Install
### Specialized install (Sloooower)
If you dont have any idea of SCSS the fast install its the best choice, anyways, for the Specialized install you can download all the .scss files, there are the variables, you can download all the files, modify them and "compile" them to your code or you can add the .scss files with the _ on the start to your scss folder and add this 4 lines to your code, and compile to apply the changes to your code, this method allows you to organize more the code and modify all quickly from the variables of the top of all files.

```
@use "smicons";
@use "footerone";
@use "footertwo";
@use "external";
```

### Base install
If you want to install this like a base of your code, I recommend download the code and delete the lines 23-65 of ```styles.scss``` and the lines 21-31 of ```index.html``` and add wherever you want, ANYWAYS, I'm gonna create a download of the code without the presentation (This is the link to download the code without presentation https://github.com/RedHht/customfooter/releases/download/1.0/Custom.Footer.Clear.Code.rar)

## Extra
Im gonna leave the code without the presentation, or the important part, anyways you can look the code in action in this link :) (This is the link to download the code without presentation https://github.com/RedHht/customfooter/releases/download/1.0/Custom.Footer.Clear.Code.rar)
